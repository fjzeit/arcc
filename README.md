# ARCC - Auto Resume CC

Automatically types "RESUME" followed by Enter into a terminal (or other application window) at a scheduled time. Useful if your llm session is mid-flight processing a prompt and you reach your usage limit and you don't want to wait around to type "resume" in the console. I found this particularly useful when a limit is reached but the reset time is early in the morning.
